# Hospital-Management-System

Build a fully functional Hospital Management System in Java that demonstrates comprehensive Object 
Oriented Programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, method 
overloading, and interface implementation. 
System Requirements 
The system must manage: 
• Patients (registration, medical history, appointments) 
• Doctors (specializations, schedules, assigned patients) 
• Nurses (departments, shifts, patient care assignments) 
• Appointments (scheduling, rescheduling, cancellations) 
• Medical Records (diagnoses, prescriptions, test results) 
• Departments (Cardiology, Neurology, Pediatrics, Emergency, General Medicine) 
• Billing (patient bills, insurance claims, payment tracking)
